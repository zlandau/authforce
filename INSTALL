Quick install:
	./configure && make && make install

Panagiotis Issaris <takis@lumumba.luc.ac.be> was kind enough to write a
configure script, along with this:

There's a configure script now. I'll explain it's behaviour.
At default it tries to use CURL if that library is available. If
you specify to use the CURL library explicitly or use the default,
it will give you a warning that it can't find CURL and will be
using dummy function instead. The warning message also includes
an URL where the user can download the CURL library.
You can explicitly disable CURL usage (and thus enable dummy functions)
even if it is available by giving configure the --without-curl argument.

-----

The search path for the datafiles can be changed with --with-path. The default
is /usr/local/share/authforce/data:../data:.

Curl can be gotten at http://curl.haxx.se/

Install readline if you don't have it

The optional config file may be installed as /usr/local/etc/authforcerc as a
global config and/or $HOME/.authforcerc. You may use authforcerc.sample as
a template. It contains (mostly) the defaults.
